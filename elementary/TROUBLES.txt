Troubles

elementary_07 - The table prints the same numbers repeatedly. This is a logic problem which is taking me an excessive amount of time to solve.

elementary_08 - This prints the same numbers repeatedly due to the structure of the for loops.

elementary_11 - Write a program that computes the sum of an alternating series where each element of the series is an expression of the form ((−1)k+1)/(2*k−1)((-1)^{k+1})/(2 * k-1) for each value of kk from 1 to a million, multiplied by 4. Or, in more mathematical notation: ∑k=1106(−1)k+12k−1=4⋅(1−1/3+1/5−1/7+1/9−1/11…). -- I can't do this math.
